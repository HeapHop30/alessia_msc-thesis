\paragraph{} Provided with all the results from the models for the detection and prediction tasks, we were able to draw conclusions. By evaluating and comparing the results, we could determine what worked better and what worse on which type of tasks. We were also able to confirm of reject some assumptions we made at the beginning and to create new hypotheses based on the results. Through the project and all the experiments, we were able to provide to the reader a quite complete overview of machine learning and deep learning methods performances on the tasks of prediction of epileptic seizures.
