\end{enumerate}
The following sections will give a short description of what has been done for each project step.

\section{Definition of the problem to solve}
\paragraph{} The problem we decided to focus on for this project is the seizure prediction problem, which consists of predicting in advance the happening of an epileptic seizure in a person. The study has been conducted using intracranial electroencephalography data (iEEG) and it is devoted to all the people suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy, which are forced to deal with epileptic seizures in everyday life. With the goal of being able to predict epileptic seizures few seconds in advance, the prediction would allow the neurostimulator to intervene in time on the patient brain in order to block the imminent occurrence of the seizure. The possibility to avoid even only a few of the epileptic seizures of a person would already improve by a lot her living standards.

\section{Research about previous approaches to the problem}
\paragraph{} Once we identified the objective problem, we spent some time inquiring about previous approaches to the problem. With this aim, we read several scientific papers in order to find out which methods have been already used and the level of performance they obtained. Through this research, we realized how much complex was the problem and how difficult it was to obtain good results, even using deep learning models. We also found out that, in order to have acceptable results, the majority of these models needed to be trained on a large amount of data, which in the case of epileptic seizures is difficult to gather.

\section{Objective of the project}
\paragraph{} Having a clearer idea of the problem we were going to face and of its level of complexity, we defined the objective of the project and its boundaries. We decided to conduct a study on different machine learning and deep learning models applied to the problem of seizure prediction, generating a review of models for this problem and looking for the best configuration for each of them. The common thread we set throughout all the models used for this project was the lack of data to train the models. Epileptic seizure data, indeed, are very difficult to gather, so we wanted to find out how well the models would have performed having a very limited amount of data available to learn from.

\section{Data collection}
\paragraph{} The data collection was out of our scope, since we were provided directly with ready-to-use data. The data collected for this project arrives from a Toronto hospital and it consist of iEEGs generated from real measurements on a patient suffering from epilepsy. The data, corresponding to 24 hours of monitoring and containing three seizures, have been cleaned and provided to us in order to be used for this project.
